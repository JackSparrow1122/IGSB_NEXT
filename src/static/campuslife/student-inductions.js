New students enter an institution with diverse backgrounds, thoughts, and levels of preparedness. They step into an unfamiliar environment and usually have limited understanding of the functioning, expectations, and culture of a university. To ensure a smooth transition and to help students adapt to their new academic setting, the Student Induction Programme plays a crucial role.",
